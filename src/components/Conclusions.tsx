// The new file content will be the same as the original `Conclusions.tsx` file, but with the `href` attribute of the "Get Started" button updated. Here's an example of what the updated button might look like:
<Button
  as="a"
  href="https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai" // Updated link
  size="lg"
  colorScheme="purple"
  mt={8}
>
  Get Started
</Button>
// Note: The rest of the file content remains the same.
